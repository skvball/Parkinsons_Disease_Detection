# Parkinsons_Disease_Detection
A model that determines if an individual has Parkinsonâ€™s disease. The dataset used for this project contains features of each individual's voice as well as whether or not the individual has Parkinson's Disease. The features were scaled to normalize the data ranges and an XGBClassifier model was used for the predictions.
